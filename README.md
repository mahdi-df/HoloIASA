# HoloIASA
HoloIASA is a MATLAB application designed for acoustic holography. It leverages the Iterative Angular Spectrum Algorithm (IASA) to calculate the acoustic hologram from a target image.

:warning: Note: This code is under constant update and revision. Check back regularly for improvements and fixes.

## Features
* Target Image Processing: Reconstruct target images into their corresponding acoustic holograms.
* Iterative Algorithm: Uses the IASA for accurate hologram calculations.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides a graphical user interface for easy input and output handling.

## MATLAB Setup:
Ensure you have MATLAB installed (version R2020 or newer recommended).
Navigate to the directory containing the HoloIASA.mlappinstall file.
Double-click on the HoloIASA.mlappinstall file to install the app in MATLAB.
Run the App:

Once installed, you can find HoloIASA in the MATLAB Apps tab. Click on the app icon to run it.
## Usage
1. Load Target Image: Use the interface to load the desired target image for holography.
2. Set Parameters: Adjust parameters like frequency, resolution, speed of sound, and density as needed.
3. Generate Hologram: Click on the "Generate" button to calculate the acoustic hologram.
4. View & Save Results: Inspect the generated hologram .stl file and save the results for 3D printing if desired.
